            How do I pronounce wush?<br>

            Whoosh!<br>
            <br>
            Can my shoot be scheduled for longer than 30 minutes?<br>
            ———<br>
            Absolutely! To schedule a longer shoot, you are welcome to book two or more shoots back-to-back. Please keep in mind the price of your shoot will increase if it's longer.<br>
            <br>
            How long after my shoot will I receive my images?<br>
            ———<br>
            Delivery times vary for headshots and portraits, but you can expect your images to be shared with you within 24 hours of your shoot. Passport photos and prints are ready by the end of the scheduled session.
