        <h1>A headshot is a portrait taken from the shoulders up. They're essential for students, professionals, athletes, actors, models, and more. They can greatly improve your LinkedIn profile, resumes, and personal brand.

            We currently offer both studio and outdoor headshots. Outdoor headshots are taken on campus.
            
            Shoots accommodate one outfit, include a minimum of 10 edited photos, and last no more than 30 minutes.</h1>
